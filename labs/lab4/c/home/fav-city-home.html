    <p>
        Cleveland Ohio was founded on 1796 along the shore of the Great Lake Erie.
        <br>
        The city was considered to be a major manufacturing and trade hub but has since declined from its towering heights.
        <br>
        Still, the city remains to be an important port city with many attractions that continues to attract residents to this day.
