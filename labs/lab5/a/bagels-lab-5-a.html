  <h1>Homemade High-Protein Queso</h1>
</header>

<p>
  Meeting <span class="word">protein</span> goals certainly isn't easy; even more so when you actually want to enjoy what you're eating.
  <br>
  This is what led me to create a <span class="word">homemade</span> queso recipe which is very high in protein while relatively low in calories.
  <br>
  Plus, who doesn't love queso? It's an incredibly versatile food which can be used in a variety of other dishes.
