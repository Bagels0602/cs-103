  <h3>A brief introduction on Michael Faeges</h3>
  <p>
    I am a junior studying international relations at the Pardee School of Global Studies and minoring in philosophy. I grew up in the greater Cleveland area of Ohio, however my parents moved to Florida shortly after my high school graduation so thatâ€™s where my license is from. My interests include working out, reading (primarily science fiction and philosophy), and I recently have gotten into collecting vinyl records.

  <h3>Vinyl to collect:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Era Vulgaris</li>
    <li>Tranquility Base</li>
    <li>Comedown Machine</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Favorite exercises for leg day:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Hack Squat</li>
    <li>RDL</li>
    <li>Kettlebell Swings</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>My weekly college schedule:</h3>
