                <p>
                    King Penguins mostly live in the sub-antarctic islands of the south. The largest collection of King Penguins can be found on the islands of Crozet Island, the Kerguelen Islands, and the Prince Edwards Islands.

                    As can be assumed with their diet, King Penguins largely prey upon fish and various other forms of small aquatic life.

                    King Penguins are preyed upon by Orcas, Leopard Seals, and certain birds such as the Skua will attempt to snatch young chicks if given the opportunity.

                The two most well known movies about penguins are the Penguins of Madagascar and Happy Feet. Notably, these are both children's animated movies. This speaks to the popularity of penguins among children and adults alike.
