            <p>
                Arctic fox diets usually consist of <strong>birds, squirrel, and lemming.</strong>
            </p>

            <h2 id="habitat">Habitat</h2>
            <p>
                The arctic fox is found in treeless coastal areas of Alaska from the Aleutian Islands north to Point Barrow and east to the Canada border. They prefer <strong>tundra habitat</strong>, usually near rocky shores, and have been observed ranging far out onto pack ice in winter.

            <h2 id="pap">Prey and Predators</h2>
            <p>
                As can be assumed with their diet, arctic foxes largely prey upon fish and various other forms of small aquatic life.
                Arctic foxes eat small mammals (especially lemmings), <em>insects, berries, carrion, marine invertebrates, seabirds and fish.</em>
                Their predators include <strong>polar bears, wolves, golden eagles, grizzly bears and humans.</strong>
