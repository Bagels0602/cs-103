        <p> A sumo stance deadlift is a variation on the traditional straight bar deadlift. While the normal deadlift form involves keeping your stance roughly shoulder width apart, <br> the sumo deadlift instead requires you stance your legs roughly a foot beyond shoulder width. This results in much greater hip-flexor and quad activation. <br> Moreover, the variation puts far less pressure on the spine which makes it a great option for those who are worried about back injury. </p>

        <ol> <h4>The Steps:</h4>
            <li>
                Stance yourself about a foot outside shoulder width with the bar placed over the center of your foot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Perform a hip-hinge in order to bend down and grab the bar (take care to keep the back straight and your core braced)
            </li>
            <li>
                Grab the bar in either an overhand or switch grip and pull yourself down a little using the bar as leverage.
            </li>
            <li>
                Take a deep breath and perform the hinge in reverse in order to lift the bar (once again, make sure that the spine is straight).
            </li>
        </ol>
